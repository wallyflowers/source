\begin{abstract}
    PULSE is a distributed network designed to help its users define their core values and to connect users with similar values. It achieves this with a novel protocol for expressing the quality of data within the network, enabling users to have total control over their system of evaluating quality using a shared language, a framework for creating and interpreting a diverse ecosystem of signal types, and interfaces for both language models and human beings. PULSE notably diverges from other network protocols by deliberately not imposing a universal definition of quality upon the network but instead suggesting a distributed language for communicating relative definitions of quality. By allowing nodes to self-organize with other nodes that have resonant ideas of quality data, nodes can form relationships of trust built on the perceived quality of their contributions to the network. Applications built with PULSE have the potential to foster naturally evolving creative communities with shared values, such as self-governing families, companies, or even countries. PULSE explicitly inherits the quality of its design through its inspiration from the enduring products of nature. Because human values are also a product of nature, their convergences and those of other natural phenomena can be viewed as a source of 'divine inspiration.' This defines a paradigm shift in how creative work can be done in technological fields, shining light on the utility of poetic and thematic approaches to the design of computational systems.
